# 📘 Project Paper 2:  Integrating Arkouda with Pachyderm on Kubernetes

This repository encompasses both the project and its corresponding paper of my semester thesis. The primary focus is on the incorporation of the HPC framework Arkouda into the Kubernetes workflow orchestrator, Pachyderm. Moreover, this repository also details the setup of a 20-node on-prem cluster using Kubeadm and delineates the infrastructure's configuration and the establishment of the CI/CD pipeline.
