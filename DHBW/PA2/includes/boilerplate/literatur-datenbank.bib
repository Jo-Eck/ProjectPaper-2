  abstract = {Containers offer a broad array of benefits, including a consistent lightweight runtime environment through OS-level virtualization, as well as low overhead to maintain and scale applications with high efficiency. Moreover, containers are known to package and deploy applications consistently across varying infrastructures. Container orchestrators manage a large number of containers for microservices based cloud applications. However, the use of such service orchestration frameworks towards HPC workloads remains relatively unexplored. In this paper we study the potential use of Kubernetes on HPC infrastructure for use by the scientific community. We directly compare both its features and performance against Docker Swarm and bare metal execution of HPC applications. Herein, we detail the configurations required for Kubernetes to operate with containerized MPI applications, specifically accounting for operations such as (1) underlying device access, (2) inter-container communication across different hosts, and (3) configuration limitations. This evaluation quantifies the performance difference between representative MPI workloads running both on bare metal and containerized orchestration frameworks with Kubernetes, operating over both Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnects. Our results show that Kubernetes and Docker Swarm can achieve near bare metal performance over RDMA communication when high performance transports are enabled. Our results also show that Kubernetes presents overheads for several HPC applications over TCP/IP protocol. However, Docker Swarm's throughput is near bare metal performance for the same applications.},

These approaches have been proven to enable high-performance execution of containers at scale with the appropriate runtimes. However, the use of these techniques are still ad hoc, test the limits of container workload portability, and several gaps likely remain.

Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, MPI, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size. We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to HPC software chaos.},

Because most end-user software packages for an HPC environment are not readily available in existing OS package managers, they require significant extra effort from the user support team. Reducing this effort would free up a large amount of time for tackling more urgent tasks. In this work, we present EasyBuild, a software installation framework written in Python that aims to support the various installation procedures used by the vast collection of software packages that are typically installed in an HPC environment - catering to widely different user profiles. It is built on top of existing tools, and provides support for well-established installation procedures. Supporting customised installation procedures requires little effort, and sharing implementations of installation procedures becomes very easy. Installing software packages that are supported can be done by issuing a single command, even if dependencies are not available yet. Hence, it simplifies the task of HPC site support teams, and even allows end-users to keep their software installations consistent and up to date.},

To address this gap, we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review, a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these investigations, we contribute to the body of knowledge by providing an aggregated overview of the necessary principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated architecture and workflows. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive definition of MLOps and highlight open challenges in the field. Finally, this work provides guidance for ML researchers and practitioners who want to automate and operate their ML products with a designated set of technologies.},

EDA is non-negotiably interactiveâby far the most popular environment for EDA is a Jupyter notebookâand, as datasets grow, increasingly computationally intensive. Several existing projects attempt to combine interactivity and distributed computation using programming paradigms and tools from cloud computing, but none of these projects have come close to meeting our needs for high-performance EDA. To fill this gap, we have developed a prototype, called arkouda, that allows a user to interactively issue massively parallel computations on distributed data.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent emergence of new workflow applications focused on data analytics and machine learning. This emergence has precipitated a change in the workflow management landscape, causing the development of new dataoriented workflow management systems (WMSs) in addition to the earlier standard of task-oriented WMSs. In this paper, we summarize three general workflow use-cases and explore the unique requirements of each use-case in order to understand how WMSs from both workflow management models meet the requirements of each workflow use-case from the userâs perspective. We analyze the applicability of the two models by carefully describing each model and by providing an examination of the different variations of WMSs that fall under the task driven model. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each workflow management model, we summarize the key features of four production-ready WMSs: Pegasus, Makeflow, Apache Airflow, and Pachyderm. To deepen our analysis of the four WMSs examined in this paper,we implement three real-world use-cases to highlight the specifications and features of each WMS. We present our final assessment of each WMS after considering the following factors: usability, performance, ease of deployment, and relevance. The purpose of this work is to offer insights from the userâs perspective into the research challenges that WMSs currently face due to the evolving workflow landscape.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, machine learning projects have become more and more relevant to various real-world use cases. The success of complex Neural Network models depends upon many factors, as the requirement for structured and machine learning-centric project development management arises. Due to the multitude of tools available for different operational phases, responsibilities and requirements become more and more unclear. In this work, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) technologies and tools for every part of the overall project pipeline, as well as involved roles, are examined and clearly defined. With the focus on the inter-connectivity of specific tools and comparison by well-selected requirements of MLOps, model performance, input data, and system quality metrics are briefly discussed. By identifying aspects of machine learning, which can be reused from project to project, open-source tools which help in specific parts of the pipeline, and possible combinations, an overview of support in MLOps is given. Deep learning has revolutionized the field of Image processing, and building an automated machine learning workflow for object detection is of great interest for many organizations. For this, a simple MLOps workflow for object detection with images is portrayed.},

  abstract = {Software developers at large tech companies spend a lot of time writing code for tasks that colleagues elsewhere in the organization have already addressed. Scripts are rarely written or documented with discovery in mind, and the APIs on which they depend are frequently inconsistent, further limiting reuse. For mobile devices the App Catalog serves as an essential intermediary, streamlining the process both for developers and end users. We've created an experimental platform called CLASP (Cloud Application Services Platform) applying that model by publishing services and datasets instead of apps. It includes support for existing APIs, and we've also created an SDK (software development kit), so our users can write other operations themselves and easily publish in the catalog for later discovery and reuse. CLASP allows us to take a very diverse set of operations and make them all available through a consistent compositional interface. For example, you can retrieve log messages using OneView and analyze the text using Autonomy, or gather system configuration using iLO interfaces and persist the results in a Vertica Database. Our internal deployment now has more than 2,000 services, and has been used by more than 150 developers. It allows application developers to discover, test, and use services while providing a seamless app-catalog-type experience for service developers, allowing them to code and test locally while semi-automating the process of publishing those in the catalog. Developed by HP Labs, CLASP is an experimental platform and not a product. This report includes an introduction, quick-start guide, and implementational details.}

  abstract = {The rapid growth of high-throughput technologies has transformed biomedical research. With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis. However, transforming data into information involves running a large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible.},

  abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been widely used in data-mining and Big Data applications as modern commercial databases start to attach an increasing importance to the analytic capabilities. In recent years, SVM was adapted to the field of High Performance Computing for power/performance prediction, auto-tuning, and runtime scheduling. However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi- and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design. To address the challenges above, we designed and implemented MIC-SVM, a highly efficient parallel SVM for~x86 based multi-core and many-core architectures, such as the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC). We propose various novel analysis methods and optimization techniques to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism provided by these architectures and serve as general optimization methods for other machine learning tools. MIC-SVM achieves 4.4â84Ã~and 18â47Ã~speedups against the popular LIBSVM, on MIC and Ivy Bridge CPUs respectively, for several real-world data-mining datasets. Even compared with GPUSVM, running on the NVIDIA k20x~GPU, the performance of our MIC-SVM is competitive. We also conduct a cross-platform performance comparison analysis, focusing on Ivy Bridge CPUs, MIC and GPUs, and provide insights on how to select the most suitable advanced architectures for specific algorithms and input data patterns.},

Containers can encapsulate complex programs with their dependencies in isolated environments making applications more portable, hence are being adopted in High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Singularity, initially designed for HPC systems, has become their de facto standard container runtime. Nevertheless, conventional HPC workload managers lack micro-service support and deeply-integrated container management, as opposed to container orchestrators. We introduce a Torque-Operator which serves as a bridge between HPC workload manager (TORQUE) and container orchestrator (Kubernetes). We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates HPC and Cloud clusters seamlessly with little interference to HPC systems where container orchestration is performed on two levels.},
