\subsection{Loosely Coupled Problems}

\ac{LCP} also known in the industry as "embarrassingly parallel" \footcite{smtn} problems are problems that can be broken up into smaller independent tasks that can be executed in parallel.

\subsection{Tightly Coupled Problems}
\label{state_of_the_art_tcp}
In contrast to \ac{LCP} problems, \ac{TCP} problems are problems that can not be broken up into smaller independent tasks that can be executed in parallel,
instead of working independently, each atomic task needs to communicate at least with one other task.
A good example of a \ac{TCP} problem are the n-body problems, where the position of each body is dependent on the position of all other bodies.
