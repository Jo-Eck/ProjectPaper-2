\section{Initial Goals}
\label{artefact_inital_goals}

As this project was first and foremost a project, designed to interactively explore the problemspace from the perspective of the \ac{HPC} community, 
all the while being contained by business requirements and time constraints, the initial goals of this project were very broad and open ended. 
At first the initial goal was simply to create a \ac{PoC} of a realistic workflow engine using the "Arkouda" project,
in order to present the Customer with a easily graspable example of its capabilities.

While we are approaching the problem from the perspective of the \ac{HPC} community, the intended enduser of this tool are the data scientists and \ac{SME}s 
that are working with the \ac{HPC} systems, and therefore the tool needs to be designed and selected with the fact in mind that the enduser will most likely not be knowledgeable in the field of \ac{HPC} or the underlying infrastructure.

In the first iteration of the project a preselection of possible Workflow management tools was given from the business side,
with the option to increase the scope if the presented tools were not sufficient.

Therefore the goals of the first iteration of this project was twofold, first to determine which, if any, of the presented tools were suitable for the task at hand,
and to determine what would make an adequate \ac{PoC} for the customer.

The following iterations are split into the tree main aspects of the project and will be discussed in their own subsections.
While these steps where happening concurrently, they each address a different aspect of the project and therefore underwent their own iterative processes.

\section{Overall Structure}

\end{figure}


As can be seen in figure \ref{abb:pachykouda_three_aspects}, the artifact is composed of 3 main components, 
the \textbf{Central Workflow Engine} which is responsible for the orchestration of the workflows (center) and interfaces directly with the underlying infrastructure,
the \textbf{\ac{HPC} Framework} which is responsible for the execution of \ac{TCP} workloads (left)
and the \textbf{Supplementary Services} which aim at improving the usability and accessability for the enduser (right).

All this is build ontop of a hardware agnostic \ac{k8s} cluster, which is responsible for the orchestration of the different components and the underlying infrastructure.
